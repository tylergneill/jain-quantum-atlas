"""Local dev server for docs/, gzip-compressing responses and setting
Cache-Control so repeated reloads during iteration (and testing over an
ngrok tunnel on a mobile data plan) don't re-transfer the full uncompressed
tree.json/changelog.json on every load. python -m http.server does neither.

Also picks WHICH tree the frontend gets. The two builders are parallel tracks
that always write their own file -- `make build` -> tree.json (all 11066 works,
no byte sizes) and `make snapshot-tree` -> snapshot_tree.json (2287 books, with
sizes). `--snapshot` serves the latter in place of the former, so the frontend
never knows which it asked for: it fetches tree.json and reads the `source`
field in the payload to label what it got.

## `--fulltext` is localhost-only, and deliberately not publishable

`--fulltext` exposes the cached corpus text at `/text/<serial>`, so the
frontend can offer a "txt" link beside the existing PDF and site-text badges.

**That text is never published.** It lives outside `docs/` -- under the
gitignored `data/` -- so no build step and no deploy can pick it up, and
GitHub Pages serves `docs/` alone. Only this dev server can reach it, and only
when explicitly asked. The flag binds to 127.0.0.1 rather than all interfaces
for the same reason: a corpus that is fine to read locally is not a corpus
this repo has any right to redistribute.

Serial -> filename comes from the fetch journal, because filenames embed a
transliterated title (`120 - karmmapradIpaH.txt`) and cannot be reconstructed
from an id. The frontend therefore asks for `/text/120` and never needs to
know what the file is called.
