"""Every networked entry point this Atlas has, and none of them live here.

Acquisition lives in the private `rivulet` package. This module is the one
place this repo names it, and it never requires it.

## What this repo can still do alone

Everything that reads a cache already on disk:

    make parse-catalog    (and, once written: count-sizes, build, changelog,
                           audit, serve)

What needs rivulet is anything that crosses the network:

    make clearance        earn Cloudflare clearance for jainqq.org in a browser
    make fetch-catalog    the 34-page Quantum catalog
    make fetch-text       one booktext JSON per item with text

**A checkout without rivulet cannot acquire anything.** That is accepted and
deliberate. If `data/` is already populated, every offline target works.

## The exit code

    0   it worked
    1   it ran and failed
    2   the machinery is not installed
"""
