"""The one place this repo names `rivulet` for text output, and it never requires it.

Writing the corpus out as files is a publishing act and lives in the private
package. This Atlas is public and **runs to completion without it**: the
catalog, the sizes and the tree are here. What rivulet adds is
`data/text_extract/`.

Every rule about the text -- the page splitter, the furniture patterns -- is
in this repo's `pipeline/text_measure.py`, which rivulet imports. So
`count_sizes` measures exactly what the extractor would write, whether or not
the extractor is installed.
